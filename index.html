                My name is Abby McLeran. My birthday is September 9th, and I am 20
                years old. I was born in Phoenix, Arizona, and I have lived there my
                whole life. I am the youngest of 3 children. I have 1 brother,
                who is 31, and 1 sister, who is 21. My brother and sister-in-law just
                had a daughter, so I am also an aunt.
            </p>

                The elementary school that I went to was called Desert Cove Elementary
                School, and my middle school was Shea Middle School. For high school,
                I went to Shadow Mountain High School.

                I play volleyball, and I have been playing it competitively since I was
                11 years old. Growing up, I played a wide variety of sports, but
                volleyball is the one that stuck the longest.
